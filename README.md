# Komoot Route Builder Challenge

## Description

This is a React application that allows you to plan your own cross country run and download it as GPX file.

## Detailed description

You can plan your favorite route across fields and hills by just placing markers as waypoints on the map. The same waypoints show up as a list where you can re-arrange and delete them until you are happy with your route. You then can download it by simply pressing the download button.
